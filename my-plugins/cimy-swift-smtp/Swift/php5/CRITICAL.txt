             !!!!! IMPORTANT INFORMATION !!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------


Upgrading to 3.3.x
--------------------

Users upgrading from version <= 3.2.x to version >= 3.3.x should be aware that:

 1. The class Swift_Connection_Exception has been renamed to Swift_ConnectionException.
    This will affect any users catching these exceptions with try/catch.  A simple find &
    replace should suffice.  The change was brought in purely for the sake of naming
    conventions with all the other exceptions.
 2. $swift->log, $swift->log->enable() and $swift->log->disable() no longer exist. You should now
    use $log = Swift_LogContainer::getLog() and $log->setLogLevel( ... ) instead.
 3. All exceptions now extend a Swift_Exception class and dump log information if available.


Upgrading from 2.x
----------------------

If you are upgrading from Version 2.x or 1.x, you MUST read the
documentation online at:

http://www.swiftmailer.org/wikidocs/

Things have changed a lot.  Your code won't work without a small
amount of attention.  For those who are impatient and want a quick-
fix answer, change references to "Swift", to "EasySwift".

e.g.

<?php

//this
require_once "lib/Swift.php";
//becomes
require_once "lib/EasySwift.php";

//this
$swift = new Swift(...);
//becomes
$swift = new EasySwift(...);

?>

NOTE: PLUGINS FROM VERSION 2 WILL NOT WORK IN THIS VERSION
